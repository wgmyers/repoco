# TODO

DONE 1. Basic node/express scaffolding

NB - we appear to have installed Bootstrap 5, which means we didn't really need
jQuery. So, to remove it or not? Let's leave it for now, but maybe lose it later.

2. Figure out per-site configuration - YAML, DB?

3. Edit page integrating file tree (?) and MD editor for markdown

4. User login

5. Git integration

6. Test suite

7. Deploy!
